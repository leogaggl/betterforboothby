Let’s be honest. How many of us have found ourselves talking (or shouting!) at the TV as we watch the news from Canberra? We see decisions being made that don’t reflect our community's values, and it’s easy to feel powerless.

But what if we could turn that frustration into action?

Here in Boothby, a growing number of us believe it's time for a change. We're tired of the 'party-over-people' politics and we’re ready to build something new – a movement that puts our community first. Inspired by the success of community independents across Australia, we know that when everyday people get organised, we can achieve incredible things.

### The First Step is a Conversation

Every successful community movement starts small. It starts with a conversation between neighbours, friends, and colleagues who all share the same feeling: *we deserve better*.

As the [Community Independents Project](https://www.communityindependentsproject.org/cip-resources/start-a-group) advises, the first step is simply to find a core group of like-minded people. It's about discovering that you're not alone in wanting a representative who is genuinely accountable to our community.

That’s exactly what we want to do now.

### Let's Get Together

We're organising a series of informal, friendly meet-ups at local pubs across Boothby. It’s a chance to:
*   Meet other people in our community who feel the same way.
*   Share your ideas and frustrations in a relaxed, welcoming space.
*   Discuss what we want from a true community independent.
*   Support some great local businesses at the same time!

There’s no set agenda and no commitment required. This isn't about signing up to a lifetime of political activism; it's about starting a conversation and seeing where it takes us. It’s about turning talk into action.

**If you're tired of shouting at the telly and are ready to start shaping our future, we want to hear from you.**

Drop us a line at **[hello@betterforboothby.com.au](mailto:hello@betterforboothby.com.au)** to register your interest, and we’ll let you know when the first meet-ups in your area are scheduled.

Let’s do this, together.

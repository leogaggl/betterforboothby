The people of the Electorate of Boothby, from the coast to the hills, in suburbs like Aberfoyle Park, Belair, Blackwood, Brighton, Glenelg, Marion, Mitcham, and Seacliff, care deeply about our environment, government integrity, and a fair go for all. We expect our elected representative to reflect those values in Canberra.

However, a look at the voting record of our current member for the Electorate of Boothby, Louise Miller-Frost, shows a worrying disconnect between what our community wants and how our vote is being used in Parliament. Since being elected in May 2022, our member has voted with the Labor party 100% of the time, even when it goes against the interests of our community and the platforms many of us voted for.

This isn't about personality; it's about policy and priorities. It's about ensuring our representative is a voice for the Electorate of Boothby first, not just a vote for a party.

### A Record of Disappointing Votes

The public voting record, available on [TheyVoteForYou.org.au](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/boothby/louise_miller-frost), shows a pattern of voting that does not align with the strong community desire for climate action and integrity.

Our current member has consistently voted **FOR**:
-   New unconventional gas mining projects.
-   "Smoke-screen" climate change strategies that favour fossil fuel industry delay tactics.
-   The introduction of a far-reaching Digital ID.

And consistently voted **AGAINST**:
-   A legislated target of net zero emissions by 2035.
-   A ban on any new fossil fuel projects.
-   Measures to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.
-   Ending government investment in and subsidies for fossil fuels.
-   Increasing public access under Freedom of Information laws.
-   Better protection for threatened native forests and bushland habitats.

### A Deeper Pattern of Party Loyalty

This isn't a recent problem. It's a pattern that has repeated for years in the Electorate of Boothby. The two previous members, [Nicolle Flint](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/boothby/nicolle_flint) (Liberal, 2016-2022) and [Andrew Southcott](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/boothby/andrew_southcott) (Liberal, 1996-2016), also voted with their party almost 100% of the time. This demonstrates a long-standing issue where the representation for the Electorate of Boothby has been dictated by party loyalty, not by the needs and values of our community.

### It Doesn't Matter Which Major Party

It doesn't seem to matter which of the major parties holds the seat. The outcome is the same: a representative who serves their party first. Both major parties rely on donations from the fossil fuel, gambling, and other powerful corporate lobbies. This "dirty money" creates a system where the interests of big donors are prioritised over the interests of the community, whether it's on climate action, integrity in politics, or fair prices for families.

### It's Time for a True Independent

The current Member for the Electorate of Boothby has never voted against the majority of their party since entering Parliament.

When a representative is bound to a party, their loyalty is ultimately to that party's agenda. They are constrained by deals made in the party room, not by the needs of their electorate.

We believe the Electorate of Boothby is ready for a representative who votes for the community, every time. An independent who can't be controlled by party bosses or silenced by factional deals.

**That's why we're here. Join us in building a better future for the Electorate of Boothby.**

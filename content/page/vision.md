## A Community-Powered Vision for a Better Boothby

For too long, the people of Boothby have been taken for granted. Our voices have been lost in partisan games, and our interests have come second to those of party donors and lobbyists. We believe it's time for a change. It's time for a representative who is truly independent and accountable only to the people they serve.

This is our vision for a stronger, fairer, and more sustainable Boothby. It's a plan built not in a backroom in Canberra, but from conversations on doorsteps, in cafes, and at community halls right here in our electorate.

### For the People: Integrity, Health, and a Fair Go

Our community deserves a representative who puts people first.

*   **Restoring Integrity and Trust:** We need to bring honesty and transparency back to politics. That means a representative who is not beholden to a party machine or big-money influence, but is instead accountable to our community. We will champion a powerful federal integrity commission and fight for stronger transparency laws, because you have a right to know how your money is spent and how decisions are made.

*   **People-First Healthcare:** Healthcare should serve people, not profits. We will work to ensure our healthcare funding goes to frontline services—our doctors, nurses, and public hospitals—not to propping up the profits of private health insurance companies. We need to strengthen Medicare and ensure everyone in Boothby can get the care they need, when they need it.

### For the Planet: A Sustainable Future

We have a responsibility to protect our beautiful local environment for our children and grandchildren.

*   **Real, Science-Based Climate Action:** The climate crisis is here, and we need to act now. We will push for a genuine and urgent response based on science, not political games. This includes legislating ambitious, science-based emissions reduction targets and ending the use of public money to subsidise fossil fuel companies.

*   **Sustainable and Thriving Communities:** A healthy environment and a healthy economy go hand-in-hand. We will support our local farmers who produce healthy food for our tables. We will champion the transition to a circular economy that prevents waste, and we will stand up for your right to repair the things you own, reducing landfill and saving you money.

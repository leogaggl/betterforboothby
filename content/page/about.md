We are a group of local residents who have come together with a common goal: to give the people of Boothby a true voice in Federal Parliament.

We are parents, small business owners, teachers, and retirees. We are your neighbours, and like you, we believe our community deserves a representative who is not tied to the dictates of a major party, but is free to act in the best interests of our electorate.

### Our Story

For years, we have watched our representatives in Canberra consistently prioritise their party over the people of Boothby. We had hope that the 2022 election might bring a change, but it soon became clear that simply changing the party in power wasn't enough to change the political games.

We saw the same 'party-over-people' tactics, the same disappointing decisions, and a representative who always voted with their party instead of for our community.

We decided it was time to build something new.

Inspired by the success of community-backed independents across Australia, we have formed this movement to find an independent candidate who will put Boothby first. We are not a political party. We are a grassroots, community-led organisation working to ensure our next federal member is one of us.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to empower the people of Boothby to elect an independent who will champion our shared values of integrity, climate action, and community well-being. We are committed to running a positive, honest, and people-powered campaign.

We believe in a better way of doing politics. Join us.

Building a better future for the Electorate of Boothby is a community effort, and we can't do it without you. Every conversation, every volunteer hour, and every donation helps us get closer to electing a truly independent voice for our electorate.

Here are the best ways you can get involved and make a real difference.

### 1. Stay Informed: Join Our Mailing List

Be the first to hear about campaign updates, events, and key political issues affecting the Electorate of Boothby. We will never share your details.

**[-> Sign up for the Better for Boothby mailing list here!](http://eepurl.com/iJt_7g)**

*(This will be a link to a Mailchimp-hosted sign-up form. A more integrated form will be added later.)*

### 2. Volunteer Your Time

Our campaign is powered by people. Whether you have a few hours a week or can help out on a single afternoon, your contribution is invaluable. We need help with:

*   Talking to people at markets and community events.
*   Letterboxing and distributing flyers.
*   Helping out with events.
*   Making phone calls to fellow community members.
*   Providing specialist skills (e.g., graphic design, data entry, event management).

If you'd like to lend a hand, please email us at **hello@betterforboothby.com.au** and let us know how you'd like to help.

### 3. Make a Donation

Running a campaign costs money. Unlike the major parties, we don't have access to millions of dollars from big corporations or unions. We rely on grassroots donations from people like you.

Your donation will go directly towards things like printing flyers, hosting community events, and advertising to get our message out.

*(A section for a donation link/button will be added here in the future.)*

### 4. Spread the Word

The most powerful thing you can do is talk to your friends, family, and neighbours. Tell them why you believe the Electorate of Boothby deserves better and why you're supporting this movement.

*   Follow us on social media (links to be added).
*   Share our posts and invite your friends to follow us.
*   Host a small get-together at your home to introduce people to the campaign.

Thank you for being part of this movement. Together, we can make a change.

### Our Promise

Our promise to you is simple:

1.  **We will never sell your data.** Your personal information is not a commodity. It will never be sold to any third party under any circumstances.
2.  **We will not share your data.** We will not share your personal information with any other organisation, campaign, or political party.
3.  **We use your data for community organising only.** The information you provide to us, such as your name and email address for our mailing list, is used purely for the purpose of organising our community movement. This includes keeping you informed about meetings, events, and important campaign updates.
